Bamboo Booking is a React App I created to understand the fundamentals of a large web-app development using the MERN stack, MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js. Bamboo bookings is a hotel booking app, that allows the user to select a city, a date and the amount of travellers, then takes them to seperate page where user can select the the Hotel. Once the user selects the Hotel, there are several types of rooms at different prices that the user can select from, the user then selects and reserves the room. The room is then reserved for the dates selected and other users cannot select that room for the same dates. If the registered user is an Admin then that user can access the admin panel where they have access to CRUD operations for the User or Hotel or Rooms.
